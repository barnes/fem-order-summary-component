## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS

### What I learned

This was pretty straight forward. Flexbox is always a Google Search black hole. SCSS rules. Github Pages rules. Probably not using line-height best practices. Formatting is ugly and the SCSS could be refactored to be cleaner.

### Continued development

- Box shadow; how to match effectively.
- Box shadwo; eliminating that edge effect.
